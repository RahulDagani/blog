    <p>India ended their 13-year wait for an ICC Cricket World Cup trophy when they beat South Africa by seven runs to lift the ICC Men’s T20 World Cup 2024 in a thrilling final at the Kensington Oval in Bridgetown, Barbados.</p>
    <p>South Africa were left heartbroken after coming close to winning their maiden world title but were eventually unable to get over the line against a strong Indian bowling lineup in a match that swayed from end to end on Saturday.</p>

    <h4>Highlights</h4>
    <p>Chasing 177 to win, the Proteas seemed in control when they needed 71 runs off 45 balls with six wickets in hand and the pair of Quinton de Kock and Heinrich Klaasen leading their chase.</p>
    <p>India, however, had not given up on their chance of winning their second T20 World Cup.</p>
    <p>All-rounder Hardik Pandya stepped up to remove Klaasen in his first over and followed it up with the crucial wicket of David Miller, courtesy of a stunning catch on the long off boundary by Suryakumar Yadav.</p>
    <p>Bumrah, too, lived up to his reputation of answering his captain’s call and breaking partnerships at the most crucial moments in the match.</p>
    <p>While Pandya may have removed the dangerous Klaasen, it was Bumrah’s in-swinging delivery to bowl out Marco Jansen that opened the gates for India.</p>

    <h2>Virat Kohli comes out of the shadows to rescue India</h2>
    <h4 style="color: grey;">But long before the match reached its thrilling finale, it was India’s limited-overs batting hero who helped his side post a challenging target for South Africa.</h4>
    <p>When India’s captain and their leading run scorer in the tournament Rohit Sharma was dismissed in the second over, South Africa looked quite pleased with their efforts. And when they sent back the dangerous Rishabh Pant and Suryakumar Yadav before five overs were completed, the Proteas were prancing around the Kensington Oval with joy.</p>
    <p>What they did not account for, though, was the man who has pulled India out of countless occasions in ICC World Cups over the past 10 years.</p>

    <h1>Man of the Match</h1>
    <h3>Virat Kohli’s 59-ball-76 plays a key role to win the match</h3>
    <img width="40%" src="https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/2024-06-29T154703Z_1488937079_UP1EK6T17UDLV_RTRMADP_3_CRICKET-T20-IND-ZAF-REPORT-1719676207.jpg?w=770&resize=770%2C522&quality=80" alt="">
    <h3>Virat Kohli:</h3>
    <p>“One day you feel like you can't get a run and this happens, God is great. (It is) just the occasion, now or never kind of situation. This was my last T20 game playing for India. We wanted to lift that cup,” he said.</p>
    <p>“Yes I have, this was an open secret (retirement). Not something that I wasn't going to announce even if we had lost. Time for the next generation to take the T20 game forward,” Kohli confirmed when asked if he was making the official announcement about him calling it a day.</p>
    <p>“It's been a long wait for us, waiting to win an ICC tournament. You look at someone like Rohit (Sharma), he's played 9 T20 World Cups and this is my sixth.

        "He deserves it. It's been difficult to hold things (emotions) back and I think it's going to sink in later. It's an amazing day and I'm thankful,” Kohli added. PTI DDV UNG</p>
